# dronone

Hardware assembly and software development on STM32 Nucleo of a self balancing quadcopter, using three PID controllers and two different filters (kalman and complementary) to calculate the YPR angles from the MPU-6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope). The drone can be controlled by an IR emitter or by smartphone (with our Android app).

Nucleo is a development board, made by ST Electronics. It is equipped with a STM32 microcontroller based on ARM Cortex-M family, adopting a 32-bit RISC architecture.
